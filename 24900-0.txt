THE

PREFACE.


In the _Preface_ to the First Number of this _Catalogue_, I mentioned that
the Design of it was Principally intended to inform Gentlemen, Ladies,
_&c._ who live remote from _London_, (at a small Expence), what Books,
Pamphlets, Prints, _&c._ were published in the Preceeding Year; with their
exact Prices, and whom printed for. And to make this _Annual Catalogue_
more Compleat and Useful, I have added an Alphabetical LIST of the
Booksellers Names, and Places of Abode, it being very proper when an
Order is sent for Books, _&c._ to mention who they are printed for, and
where they live.
